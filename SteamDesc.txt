Certain diplomatic actions are now only possible if you are bordering the recipient empire (or if they are bordering a subject/federation member of yours). This includes wormholes, gateways, and L-Gates. These actions are:

- Any Subjugation Demands
- Forming Federations

Certain diplomatic actions have the above limitations, while additionally being able to make contact through sharing direct neighbors. These actions are:

- Forming Defensive Pacts
- Guaranteeing Independence


The goal of this was to clean up how often the AI would form relationships with empires that were nowhere near them. I felt it was extremely unrealistic. It would also often lead to wars that were impossible to end, as enemy allies were on the other side of the galaxy with no way to reach them. I also really didn't like when Federations would be blobbed across the galaxy. Now, Federations will be contiguous.

With these changes, this mod cleans up the diplomatic interactions in the galaxy, leading to a more realistic diplomatic experience.
